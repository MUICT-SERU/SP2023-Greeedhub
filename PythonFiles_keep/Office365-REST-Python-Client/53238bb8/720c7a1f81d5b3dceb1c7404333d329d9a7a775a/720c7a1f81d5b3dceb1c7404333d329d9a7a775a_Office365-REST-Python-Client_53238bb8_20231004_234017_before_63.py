"""
There are two approaches for doing app-only for SharePoint:

   - Using an Azure AD application: this is the preferred method when using SharePoint Online because you can also
    grant permissions to other Office 365 services (if needed) + you’ve a user interface (Azure portal) to maintain
    your app principals.

   - Using a SharePoint App-Only principal: this method is older and only works for SharePoint access,
     but is still relevant. This method is also the recommended model when you’re still working in SharePoint
     on-premises since this model works in both SharePoint on-premises as SharePoint Online.

Important:
        Please safeguard the created client id/secret combination as would it be your administrator account.
        Using this client id/secret one can read/update all data in your SharePoint Online environment!

The example demonstrates how to use SharePoint App-Only principal (second option)
