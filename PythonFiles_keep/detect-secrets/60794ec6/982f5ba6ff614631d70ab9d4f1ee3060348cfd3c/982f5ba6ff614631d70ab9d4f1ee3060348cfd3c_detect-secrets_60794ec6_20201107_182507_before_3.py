        Removes invalid entries in the current SecretsCollection.

        This behaves *kinda* like set intersection and left-join. That is, for matching files,
        a set intersection is performed. For non-matching files, only the files in `self` will
        be kept.

        This is because we may not be constructing the other SecretsCollection with the same
        information as we are with the current SecretsCollection, and we cannot infer based on
        incomplete information. As such, we will keep the status quo.

        Assumptions:
            1. Both `scanned_results` and the current SecretsCollection are constructed using
               the same settings (otherwise, we can't determine whether a missing secret is due
               to newly filtered secrets, or actually removed).

        :param filelist: files without secrets are not present in `scanned_results`. Therefore,
            by supplying this additional filelist, we can assert that if an entry is missing in
            `scanned_results`, it must not have secrets in it.
