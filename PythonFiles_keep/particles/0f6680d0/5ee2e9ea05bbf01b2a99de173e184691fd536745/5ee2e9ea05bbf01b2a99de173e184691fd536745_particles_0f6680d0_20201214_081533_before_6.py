"""Single-run variance estimators.

Overview
========

As discussed in Section 19.3 of the book, several recent papers (Chan & Lai,
2013; Lee & Whiteley, 2018; Olsson & Douc, 2019) have proposed variance
estimates that may be computed from a **single** run of the algorithm. These
estimates rely on genealogy tracking; more precisely they require to track eve
variables; i.e. the index of the ancestor at time 0 (or some other origin, in
Olsson and Douc, 2019) of each particle X_t^n. See function ``var_estimate``
for the exact expression of this type of estimate.

Variance estimators (Chan & Lai, 2013; Lee & Whiteley, 2018)
============================================================

These estimates may be *collected* (see module ``collectors``) as follows::

    #  same as before
    #  ...
    # phi = lambda x: x  # for instance
    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=my_fk_model, N=100, var_est=phi)

This will compute at each time t an estimate of the variance of
:math:`\sum_{n=1}^N W_t^n \varphi(X_t^n)` (which is itself a particle estimate
of expectation :math:`\mathbb{Q}_t(\varphi)`).

You can also estimate the variance of the normalising constant as follows::

    #  same as before
    #  ...
    # phi = lambda x: x  # for instance
    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=my_fk_model, N=100, var_est_norm_cst=True)

This one is a bit tricky: it returns at time t an estimate of the *relative*
variance (variance divided expectation squared) of the normalising constant
:math:`L_{t-1}` (at time t-1). This is inherent to the method. To get this
estimate at the final time T, you may add one extra (arbitrary) point to the
data.

In both cases, the estimators from Chan & Lai (2013) are computed. To compute
the version from Lee & Whiteley (2018), you must multiply by a factor
:math:`(N/(N-1))^t` at time t.

Lag-based variance estimators (Olsson and Douc, 2019)
=====================================================

The above estimators suffer from the well known problem of **particle
degeneracy**; as soon as the number of distinct ancestors falls to one, these
variance estimates equal zero. Olsson and Douc (2019) proposed a variant based
on a fixed-lag approximation. To compute it, you need to activate the tracking
of a rolling-window history, as for fixed-lag smoothing (see below)::

    k = 10  # for instance
    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=my_fk_model, N=100, lag_based_var_est=phi,
                           store_history=k)

which is going to compute the same type of estimates, but using as eve
variables (called Enoch variables in Olsson and Douc) the index of the ancestor
of each particle :math:`X_t^n` as time :math:`t-l`, where `l` is the lag.
This collector actually computes and stores simultaneously the estimates that
correspond to lags 0, 1, ..., k (where `k` is the size of the rolling window
history). This makes it easier to assess the impact of the lag on the
estimates. Thus

    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=my_fk_model, N=100, lag_based_var_est=phi,
                           store_history=10)
    my_alg.run()
    print(my_alg.lag_based_var_est[-1])  # prints a list of length 10
