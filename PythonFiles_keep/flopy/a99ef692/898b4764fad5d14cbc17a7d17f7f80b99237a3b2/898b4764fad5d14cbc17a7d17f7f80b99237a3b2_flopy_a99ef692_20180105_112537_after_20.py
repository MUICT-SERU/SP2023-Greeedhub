    """
    ModflowGwflak defines a lak package within a gwf6 model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    auxiliary : [string]
        * auxiliary (string) defines an array of one or more auxiliary variable
          names. There is no limit on the number of auxiliary variables that
          can be provided on this line; however, lists of information provided
          in subsequent blocks must have a column of data for each auxiliary
          variable name defined here. The number of auxiliary variables
          detected on this line determines the value for naux. Comments cannot
          be provided anywhere on this line as they will be interpreted as
          auxiliary variable names. Auxiliary variables may not be used by the
          package, but they will be available for use by other parts of the
          program. The program will terminate with an error if auxiliary
          variables are specified on more than one line in the options block.

          texttt{lakeno}.
        * cellid ((integer, ...)) is the cell identifier, and depends on the
          type of grid that is used for the simulation. For a structured grid
          that uses the DIS input file, cellid is the layer, row, and column.
          For a grid that uses the DISV input file, cellid is the layer and
          cell2d number. If the model uses the unstructured discretization
          (DISU) input file, then cellid is the node number for the cell.
        * claktype (string) character string that defines the lake-texttt{GWF}
          connection type for the lake connection. Possible lake-texttt{GWF}
          connection type strings include: texttt{VERTICAL}--character keyword

          corresponding to the :math:`K_{33}` tensor component defined for
          texttt{cellid} in the NPF package. texttt{HORIZONTAL}--character
          keyword to indicate the lake-texttt{GWF} connection is horizontal and

          connection is embedded in a single cell and connection conductance
          calculations use the hydraulic conductivity corresponding to the
          :math:`K_{33}` tensor component defined for \texttt{cellid} in the
          NPF package. Embedded lakes can only be connected to a single cell
          (\texttt{nlakconn = 1}) and there must be a lake table associated
          with each embedded lake.
        * bedleak (double) character string or real value that defines the bed
          leakance for the lake-texttt{GWF} connection. texttt{bedleak} must be

          texttt{cellid}.
        * telev (double) real value that defines the top elevation for a
          texttt{HORIZONTAL} lake-texttt{GWF} connection. Any value can be
          specified if texttt{claktype} is texttt{VERTICAL}, texttt{EMBEDDEDH},

          for a texttt{HORIZONTAL} lake-texttt{GWF} connection.
          texttt{connwidth} must be greater than zero for a texttt{HORIZONTAL}
          lake-texttt{GWF} connection. Any value can be specified if
          texttt{claktype} is texttt{VERTICAL}, texttt{EMBEDDEDH}, or

        * rate (string) real or character value that defines the extraction
          rate for the lake outflow. A positive value indicates inflow and a
          negative value indicates outflow from the lake. texttt{rate} only
          applies to active (texttt{IBOUND}:math:`>0`) lakes. A specified
          \texttt{rate} is only applied if \texttt{couttype} for the
          \texttt{outletno} is \texttt{SPECIFIED}. If the Options block
          includes a \texttt{TIMESERIESFILE} entry (see the "Time-Variable
          Input" section), values can be obtained from a time series by
          entering the time-series name in place of a numeric value. By
          default, the \texttt{rate} for each \texttt{SPECIFIED} lake outlet is
          zero.
    outletperiodrecarray : [outletno, outletsetting]
        * outletno (integer) integer value that defines the outlet number
          associated with the specified PERIOD data on the line.
          texttt{outletno} must be greater than zero and less than or equal to
          texttt{noutlets}.
        * outletsetting (keystring) line of information that is parsed into a
          keyword and values. Keyword values that can be used to start the

          texttt{WIDTH}, texttt{SLOPE}, and texttt{ROUGH}.
            rough : [string]
                * rough (string) real or character value that defines the width
                  of the lake outlet. A specified texttt{width} value is only
                  used for active lakes if texttt{couttype} for lake outlet
                  texttt{outletno} is not texttt{SPECIFIED}. If the Options
                  block includes a texttt{TIMESERIESFILE} entry (see the "Time-

                  series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric
                  value.
            slope : [string]
                * slope (string) real or character value that defines the bed
                  slope for the lake outlet. A specified texttt{slope} value is
                  only used for active lakes if texttt{couttype} for lake
                  outlet texttt{outletno} is texttt{MANNING}. If the Options
                  block includes a texttt{TIMESERIESFILE} entry (see the "Time-

                  series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric
                  value.
            width : [string]
                * width (string) real or character value that defines the width
                  of the lake outlet. A specified texttt{width} value is only
                  used for active lakes if texttt{couttype} for lake outlet
                  texttt{outletno} is not texttt{SPECIFIED}. If the Options
                  block includes a texttt{TIMESERIESFILE} entry (see the "Time-

            rate : [string]
                * rate (string) real or character value that defines the
                  extraction rate for the lake outflow. A positive value
                  indicates inflow and a negative value indicates outflow from
                  the lake. texttt{rate} only applies to active
                  (texttt{IBOUND}:math:`>0`) lakes. A specified \texttt{rate}
                  is only applied if \texttt{couttype} for the

                  series by entering the time-series name in place of a numeric
                  value. By default, the \texttt{rate} for each
                  \texttt{SPECIFIED} lake outlet is zero.
            invert : [string]
                * invert (string) real or character value that defines the
                  invert elevation for the lake outlet. A specified
                  texttt{invert} value is only used for active lakes if
                  texttt{couttype} for lake outlet texttt{outletno} is not
                  texttt{SPECIFIED}. If the Options block includes a
