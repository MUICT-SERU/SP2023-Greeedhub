## Visualization_Graph

The `visualization_Graph` folder contains the results of visualizing various competency score data. The folder is organized into five subfolders and 40 results in HTML files.

<sub>**Note:** All file paths and references within these HTML files are designed to be run locally on your machine.</sub>

### Folder Structure and How to run

1. **change_to_zero**  
   This folder contains the code to modify the competency scores (dataset). Any negative differences in the scores have been changed to zero. This adjustment applies to both `CompetencyScore_Alive` and `CompetencyScore_Dead`.

   **To run change_to_zero_Alive and change_to_zero_Dead**
   
   Just "Run Python File"

3. **CompetencyScore_Alive**  
   This folder holds the results after applying the changes made in the `change_to_zero` folder. It contains the adjusted competency scores for the 20 "Alive" projects.

4. **CompetencyScore_Dead**  
   Similar to the `CompetencyScore_Alive` folder, this one contains the results after applying the changes made in the `change_to_zero` folder. It contains the adjusted competency scores for the 20 "Dead" projects.

5. **Visualize_Alive_project**  
   This folder contains 20 Python files that generate visualization graphs for the "Alive" category.

   **To run each file in Visualize_Alive_project**
   
   Just "Run Python File"

7. **Visualize_Dead_project**  
   Similar to the `Visualize_Alive_project` folder. This folder contains 20 Python files that generate visualization graphs for the "Dead" category.

   **To run each file in Visualize_Alive_project**
   
   Just "Run Python File"

9. **40 results in HTML files**
   There are 40 results in HTML files from Visualize_Alive_project and Visualize_Dead_project folder. The visualizations include a spider chart and a slider graph of overall project, and spider charts and slider graphs of each contributor.

   **To run change_to_zero_Alive and change_to_zero_Dead**
   
   Click "Run" --> "Start Debugging" --> and choose Web App to visualize the result, such as Chrome or Edge

## Dataset
The dataset is now available in Google Drive [Data/Project_CompetencyScore].
