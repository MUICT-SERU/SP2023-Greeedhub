Solver interface for qpSWIFT

qpSWIFT is light-weight sparse Quadratic Programming solver targetted for
embedded and robotic applications. It employs Primal-Dual Interioir Point
method with Mehrotra Predictor corrector step and Nesterov Todd scaling. For
solving the linear system of equations, sparse LDL' factorization is used along
with approximate minimum degree heuristic to minimize fill-in of the
factorizations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P :
        Symmetric quadratic-cost matrix.
    q :
        Quadratic-cost vector.
    G :
