""" Python build tool (make replacement) that automatically finds dependencies.

fabricate is the best thing to happen to build tools since memoize.py. It
automatically finds dependencies, and it lets you write your build scripts in
a real programming language -- Python.

With fabricate, you'll have no more of this (from the make docs):

files.o : files.c defs.h buffer.h command.h
        cc -c files.c

You just tell fabricate to run('cc -c files.c') and it'll figure out what
files.o depends on, automatically. Next time you build, the command will only
get run if its dependencies have changed (or its outputs don't exist).

And no more write-only crud like this:

%.d : %.c
        @set -e; rm -f $@; \
         $(CC) -M $(CPPFLAGS) $< > $@.$$$$; \
         sed 's,\($*\)\.o[ :]*,\1.o $@ : ,g' < $@.$$$$ > $@; \
         rm -f $@.$$$$

Here's an example build file using fabricate:

-----
from fabricate import *

sources = ['program', 'util']

def build():
    compile()
    link()

def compile():
    for source in sources:
        run('gcc -c ' + source + '.c')

def link():
    objects = ' '.join(s + '.o' for s in sources)
    run('gcc -o program ' + objects)

def clean():
    autoclean()

main()
-----

What is fabricate not good for? If you don't know what KISS means, or you like
the phrase "enterprise software", fabricate probably isn't for you. fabricate
doesn't use XML, web 2.0, or any other buzzword. Sorry.

fabricate is inspired by Bill McCloskey's memoize, but works under Windows as
well by using file access times instead of strace if access time updates
are available on your file system (works for FAT and NTFS). Bill's original
memoize web page lives at:
    http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~billm/memoize.html

fabricate was developed by Brush Technology for in-house use, but we thought
it was cool enough to release to the world. Brush's website is at:
    http://brush.co.nz/

Like memoize, fabricate is released under a "New BSD license". fabricate is
