## Visualization_Graph

The `visualization_Graph` folder contains the results of visualizing various competency score data. The folder is organized into five subfolders and 40 results in HTML files.

### Folder Structure

1. **change_to_zero**  
   This folder contains the results of modifying the competency scores. Any negative differences in the scores have been changed to zero. This adjustment applies to both `CompetencyScore_Alive` and `CompetencyScore_Dead`.

2. **CompetencyScore_Alive**  
   This folder holds the results after applying the changes made in the `change_to_zero` folder. It contains the adjusted competency scores for the 20 "Alive" projects.

3. **CompetencyScore_Dead**  
   Similar to the `CompetencyScore_Alive` folder, this one contains the results after applying the changes made in the `change_to_zero` folder. It contains the adjusted competency scores for the 20 "Dead" projects.

4. **Visualize_Alive_project**  
   This folder contains 20 HTML files that generate visualization graphs for the "Alive" category. The visualizations include spider charts and slider graphs.

5. **Visualize_Dead_project**  
   Similar to the `Visualize_Alive_project` folder. This folder contains 20 HTML files that generate visualization graphs for the "Dead" category. The visualizations include spider charts and slider graphs.
