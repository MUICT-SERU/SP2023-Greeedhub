"""
This example specifies a KQL query which does the following:

   - Looks into the DeviceProcessEvents table in the advanced hunting schema.
   - Filters on the condition that the event is initiated by the powershell.exe process.
   - Specifies the output of 3 columns from the same table for each row: Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessFileName.
   - Sorts the output by the Timestamp value.
   - Limits the output to 2 records (2 rows)
