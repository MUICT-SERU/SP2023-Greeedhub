"""USB driver for the NZXT Smart Device.

The device is a fan and LED controller that ships with the H200i, H400i, H500i
and H700i cases.

It provides three independent fan channels with standard 4-pin connectors.
Both PWM and DC control is supported, and the device automatically chooses the
appropriate mode.

Additionally, up to four chained HUE+ LED strips can be driven from a single
channel.  The firmware installed on the device exposes several presets, most of
them familiar to other NZXT products.

A microphone is also present onboard, for  noise level optimization through CAM
and AI.

This driver implements all features available at the hardware level:

 - initialize
 - detect connected fans and LED strips
 - control fan speed per channel
 - monitor fan presence, control mode, speed, voltage and current
 - customize and apply color modes
 - report LED strip count
 - monitor the noise level with the onboard microphone
 - report the firmware version

After powering on from Mechanical Off, or if there have been hardware changes,
the device must be initilizated by calling `initialize()`: connected fans and
LED strips will be detected and data reporting will begin.

Software based features offered by CAM, like noise level optimization, have not
been implemented.
