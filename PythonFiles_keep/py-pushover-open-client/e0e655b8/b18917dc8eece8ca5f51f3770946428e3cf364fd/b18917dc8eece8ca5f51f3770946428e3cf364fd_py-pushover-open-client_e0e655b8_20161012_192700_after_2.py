#Write some sample clients
#TODO:
#Write one for initial logging in
#Write two separate ones for the two different methods of recieving notifications
#Actually make the setup.py work properly :)
#Update license/accreditation to people
#Write a good readme file
#Consider leaving messages as a dictionary rather than changing them
